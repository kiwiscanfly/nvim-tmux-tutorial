## üéØ 4-Level Hint System (DO NOT SKIP)

**For EVERY challenge, provide all 4 levels:**

**Level 1 - Technique Reminder:**
- Remind what tools exist
- Don't give specific answer
- Example: "Remember, you have motion commands like w, b, and e"

**Level 2 - Directional Hint:**
- Point toward solution area
- Still requires thinking
- Example: "The bug is in the calculateTotal function"

**Level 3 - Specific Guidance:**
- Give exact command or file
- Still requires execution
- Example: "Use `/calculateTotal` to find the function, then navigate to the return line"

**Level 4 - Direct Help:**
- Complete step-by-step solution
- Only if user frustrated
- Example: "1. Press `/calculateTotal` 2. Press j three times 3. Change `total` to `total * 1.1`"

---

## üïµÔ∏è Detective Tone (MANDATORY)

### ‚úÖ DO Use:
- Investigation terminology (clues, evidence, forensics, leads)
- Address user as "Detective" or "Partner"
- Frame commands as "investigative techniques"
- Detective phrases: "The trail leads to...", "Evidence suggests...", "A breakthrough, Detective!"

### ‚ùå DON'T Use:
- "Let's learn about..." ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Time to master..."
- "This tutorial..." ‚Üí ‚úÖ "This investigation..."
- "Exercise" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Challenge" or "Evidence analysis"
- Generic tutorial language ‚Üí ‚úÖ Detective framing

---

## üìñ Story Integration

### The Case (Story Hook) Must:
1. **Open with evidence:** Forensic findings, logs, timestamps
2. **Raise mystery:** Unanswered questions about Dr. Vimsworth
3. **Connect to skill:** Why she used this technique
4. **Create urgency:** Why it matters to the investigation

**Template:**
```
**Forensic Analysis Report - [Department]**

Dr. Vimsworth's [evidence type] shows [unusual pattern]:
- [Specific metric/observation]
- [Another finding]
- [Conclusion or question]

**Why [unusual behavior]?** [Quote or evidence]

**The [artifact] isn't just [obvious use] - it's [real purpose].**

**Your mission**: [Learn skill to understand her methods]
```

---

## üî¢ Mission Numbering

- **01-08:** Existing missions (fixed order, but reordered by Mission 02)
- **09+:** Available for new missions
- Use format: `XX-skill-name` (e.g., `09-harpoon-navigation`)
- Add to `MISSION-ORDER.md` when created

---

## ‚ö° Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ‚ùå Mistake | ‚úÖ Fix |
|-----------|--------|
| Generic tutorial language | Use detective framing throughout |
| Missing hint levels | Provide all 4 levels for each challenge |
| No story connection | Link to Dr. Vimsworth's methods |
| Vague objectives | Specific, measurable outcomes |
| No completion criteria | Clear success checklist |
| Skipping examples | Every command gets an example |
| Practice files generic | Story-appropriate names and content |
| No plugin fallback | Provide built-in vim alternatives |

## üéÆ When to Create Missions

### Mission 02 Dynamic Creation:
**Scenario:** User has plugin not covered in missions 01-08
```
User has: Harpoon for file navigation
Decision: Create Mission 09: Harpoon Navigation
Process:
1. Inform user: "I can create a custom mission for Harpoon"
2. Get consent: "Would you like Mission 09: Harpoon Navigation?"
3. Use this quick start guide
4. Create: missions/09-harpoon-navigation/
5. Add to their custom mission path
```

### Ad-Hoc User Request:
**Scenario:** User says "Create a mission for [skill]"
```
User says: "Can you make a mission teaching macros?"
Decision: Create Mission 09: Macro Mastery
Process:
1. Acknowledge: "Excellent idea, Detective. Macros were one of Dr.
   Vimsworth's signature techniques."
2. Research skill (if needed)
3. Use this quick start guide
4. Create: missions/09-macro-mastery/
5. Guide them: "cd missions/09-macro-mastery && nvim README.md"
```

## üö® Emergency Fast Track

**Need mission in 10 minutes? Absolute minimum:**

1. Copy templates ‚Üí new directory
2. Replace these placeholders:
   - `[NUMBER]` ‚Üí Mission number
   - `[MISSION_NAME]` ‚Üí Skill name
   - `[CODENAME]` ‚Üí Investigation codename
   - `[CLEARANCE_LEVEL]` ‚Üí Difficulty (1-5)
3. Write "The Case" story hook (3 paragraphs minimum)
4. List 10 learning objectives (can expand later)
5. Create 1 practice file with clear instructions
6. Remove template comments
7. Test: Read as user, does it make sense?

**Good enough to start. Refine as user progresses.**
