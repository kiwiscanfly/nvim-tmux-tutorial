# Pre-Creation Planning Checklist

Use this checklist BEFORE you start creating a new mission to ensure proper planning and design.

---

## 1. Mission Concept Definition

- [ ] **Skill identified**: What specific Neovim/tmux skill will this mission teach?
- [ ] **Learning objectives clear**: Can you list 3-5 specific things users will learn?
- [ ] **Prerequisite analysis**: What skills from previous missions are required?
- [ ] **Difficulty assessed**: Is this appropriately placed in the mission sequence?

**Questions to answer:**
- What is the ONE core skill this mission focuses on?
- Why is this skill important for the investigation/workflow?
- What should users be able to do after completing this mission?

---

## 2. Story Integration

- [ ] **Story hook planned**: How does this mission connect to Dr. Vimsworth's disappearance?
- [ ] **Evidence framed**: What clues/evidence will this mission reveal?
- [ ] **Detective framing ready**: How will you present this skill in investigation terms?
- [ ] **No spoilers**: Confirmed this doesn't reveal future plot points prematurely?

**Story questions:**
- What did Dr. Vimsworth use this skill for?
- What evidence/logs suggest she mastered this technique?
- How does this advance the investigation narrative?
- Does this fit the current story phase (I: Foundation, II+: Deeper mysteries)?

---

## 3. Practice Method Design

- [ ] **Hands-on approach chosen**: Will this use challenges, refactoring, exploration, or game-based learning?
- [ ] **Practice files planned**: What code/data files will users work with?
- [ ] **Clear success criteria**: How will users know they've completed the mission?
- [ ] **Difficulty progression**: Does practice start easy and build to advanced?

**Design questions:**
- How will users PRACTICE this skill (not just read about it)?
- What makes this practice engaging (gamification, story, real scenarios)?
- How many practice exercises are needed (typically 3-7)?
- What's the "aha!" moment or breakthrough users will experience?

---

## 4. Plugin Dependencies

- [ ] **Dependencies identified**: What plugins does this mission require?
- [ ] **Mission 02 compatibility**: Checked how to handle users without these plugins?
- [ ] **Fallback planned**: If plugin missing, can mission adapt or should it be skipped?
- [ ] **Installation guide ready**: Can you help users install missing plugins if needed?

**Dependency questions:**
- Required plugins: _________________
- Optional plugins: _________________
- Built-in vim alternative available? Yes/No
- Mission position after reordering: _________________

---

## 5. Learning Objectives Scope

- [ ] **20-40 objectives planned**: Comprehensive list of skills to teach
- [ ] **Organized into 4-6 categories**: Logical grouping of related skills
- [ ] **Progressive difficulty**: Objectives flow from basic → intermediate → advanced
- [ ] **Measurable outcomes**: Each objective is specific and verifiable

**Categories to consider:**
- Core fundamentals (basic commands)
- Advanced techniques (power features)
- Integration & workflow (combining with other skills)
- Professional application (real-world usage)
- Advanced concepts (edge cases, plugins, efficiency)

---

## 6. Command Reference Preparation

**Command categories:**
- Navigation commands
- Editing commands
- Text objects/motions
- Special features
- Plugin-specific commands

---

## 7. Progressive Hint System

- [ ] **4-level hints planned**: For each challenge, prepared all hint levels
- [ ] **Level 1 (Reminder)**: General technique reminder written
- [ ] **Level 2 (Directional)**: Pointing hints ready
- [ ] **Level 3 (Specific)**: Exact commands identified
- [ ] **Level 4 (Complete)**: Step-by-step solutions prepared

**For each major challenge:**
1. What tools exist? (Level 1)
2. Where to look? (Level 2)
3. What specific command? (Level 3)
4. Exact steps? (Level 4)

---

## 8. Common Issues Anticipation

- [ ] **5-10 issues identified**: Predicted problems users will encounter
- [ ] **Diagnostic questions ready**: How to identify each issue
- [ ] **Solutions prepared**: How to fix each issue
- [ ] **Detective framing**: How to explain issues in-character

**Common issue categories:**
- Command confusion
- Plugin errors
- Keybinding conflicts
- Conceptual misunderstandings
- Technical errors

---

## 9. Completion Verification

- [ ] **Clear completion criteria**: Defined what "mission complete" means
- [ ] **Demonstration tasks**: Prepared tasks to verify understanding
- [ ] **Skill checks**: Know how to test if they've mastered concepts
- [ ] **Flexible standards**: Defined minimum vs. perfect completion

**Verification methods:**
- Checklist of completed tasks
- Demonstration requests
- Explanation questions
- Performance benchmarks (par scores, time limits)

---

## 10. Mission Positioning

- [ ] **Mission number chosen**: Fits in sequence (01-08 currently, 09+ available)
- [ ] **Previous mission reviewed**: Checked what skills user has at this point
- [ ] **Next mission considered**: Prepared transition and skill build-up
- [ ] **MISSION-ORDER.md**: Ready to update with new mission

**Sequencing questions:**
- What mission comes before this? _________________
- What skills do they have at this point? _________________
- What mission comes after this? _________________
- How does this build toward the next skill? _________________

---

## 11. File Structure Planning

- [ ] **Directory name ready**: XX-mission-name format chosen
- [ ] **Practice files named**: All code/data files have story-appropriate names
- [ ] **README structure sketched**: Outline of sections prepared
- [ ] **CLAUDE structure sketched**: Teaching strategy outlined

**Files to create:**
- [ ] README.md (user-facing mission brief)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md (AI teaching guidance)
- [ ] Practice files (3-10 files typical)
- [ ] Optional: scorecard, hints, solution files

---

## 12. Creative Elements

- Vim best practices
- Tutorial design principles

---

## 14. Accessibility & Adaptation

- [ ] **Minimalist path considered**: Works without plugins if needed?
- [ ] **Alternative methods**: Prepared built-in vim equivalents?
- [ ] **Clear explanations**: Concepts explained without jargon?
- [ ] **Multiple learning styles**: Visual, hands-on, and reading materials?

**Adaptation scenarios:**
- User has all plugins → Full mission
- User missing key plugin → Adapted version or skip
- User is advanced → Bonus challenges
- User is struggling → Simplified approach

---

## 15. Quality Standards

- [ ] **Detective tone planned**: All text maintains noir/investigation style
- [ ] **No generic language**: Replaced tutorial-speak with story-driven wording
- [ ] **Consistent terminology**: Matches existing missions' vocabulary
- [ ] **Professional polish**: Grammar, formatting, structure are clean

**Tone checklist:**
- ✅ Uses investigation terminology (clues, evidence, forensics)
- ✅ Refers to user as "Detective"
- ✅ Frames commands as investigation techniques
- ✅ Maintains mystery and intrigue
- ❌ No casual modern language
- ❌ No generic tutorial phrases

## Final Pre-Creation Questions

Before proceeding to creation:

1. **Can you explain this mission in 2 sentences?**
   _________________________________________________________________

2. **What's the "aha!" moment users will have?**
   _________________________________________________________________

3. **How does this advance the investigation story?**
   _________________________________________________________________

4. **What makes this mission engaging (beyond just learning)?**
   _________________________________________________________________

5. **Is this appropriately scoped (not too big, not too small)?**
   _________________________________________________________________

## Sign-Off

Mission concept is ready for creation when:
- [ ] All sections above are checked and answered
- [ ] Story hook is compelling and fits narrative
- [ ] Practice method is engaging and hands-on
- [ ] Learning objectives are comprehensive (20-40 items)
- [ ] Hint system is planned for all challenges
- [ ] Common issues are anticipated
- [ ] File structure is clear
- [ ] Mission positioning makes sense

**Ready to proceed?** If yes, move to `during-creation.md` checklist.

**Need more planning?** Review sections that are incomplete and refine the design.

**TIP**: Don't rush this phase. A well-planned mission writes itself. A poorly planned mission requires constant revision.
