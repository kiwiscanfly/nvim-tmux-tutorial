## CASE SUMMARY

**Date of Disappearance:** March 15, 2022, 11:47 PM
**Last Known Location:** Remote workstation, Project Prometheus
**Last Known Activity:** Git commit with cryptic message
**Evidence:** Scattered code fragments, hidden tokens, encrypted messages

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Detective, you've been brought onto this cold case. Dr. Elena Vimsworth—known in the industry as "The Text Surgeon"—vanished without a trace. Her final commit mentioned patterns, tokens, and hidden truths.

**Your mission:** Master her investigative tools and uncover what happened.

## 📖 NAVIGATING THIS FILE (Your First Lesson)

You're reading this in **Neovim**—Dr. Vimsworth's editor of choice. Here are the essential commands to navigate this case file:

### Moving Around
```
j          Move down one line
k          Move up one line
h          Move left one character
l          Move right one character

Ctrl+d     Scroll down half a page
Ctrl+u     Scroll up half a page

gg         Jump to top of file
G          Jump to bottom of file
```

### Searching
```
/text      Search for "text" (press Enter, then n for next match)
?text      Search backwards
```

### Exiting
```
:q         Quit (returns you to terminal)
:q!        Quit without saving
```

**Try it now:** Press `j` a few times to scroll down. Press `gg` to jump back to the top. Press `/MISSION` and Enter to find the missions section.

When you're ready to continue, keep reading below.

## CASE BRIEFING

Dr. Vimsworth worked exclusively with **Neovim** and **tmux**. No IDE. No mouse. Just raw terminal efficiency. To understand her disappearance, you must learn to work as she did.

She left behind:
- 13 coded tokens scattered across Project Prometheus
- Practice missions demonstrating her techniques
- Configuration files with suspicious modifications
- A cryptic final message

## THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS

```bash
# Start your investigation (Mission 01 - Foundation)
cd missions/01-tmux-workflows
nvim README.md
```

## INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS

### Core Equipment

**Neovim** - Text manipulation and code analysis
- Telescope: Search and filter evidence
- Neo-tree: Navigate file structures
- LSP: Intelligent code understanding

**Tmux** - Workspace organization and persistence
- Sessions: Persistent investigation environments
- Windows: Parallel case tracking
- Panes: Split-screen analysis

## EVIDENCE CHAIN

Dr. Vimsworth's final commit:

```
commit 3a8b9f2
Author: Elena Vimsworth <elena@prometheus.dev>
Date:   Tue Mar 15 23:47:33 2022 -0700

    The pattern is clear now. They're in the tokens.
    If you're reading this, find them all.
    The truth is h̵i̴d̸d̴e̵n̸ ̶i̴n̴ ̵t̸h̸e̷ ̵m̸o̶t̸i̸o̷n̴s̸.
```

## CASE REQUIREMENTS

**Prerequisites:**
- Neovim 0.9+ installed
- Tmux 3.0+ installed
- Terminal access
- Determination to solve the case

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Telescope plugin for Neovim
- Neo-tree file explorer
- Basic familiarity with command line

## INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES

1. **Missions are modular** - Tackle them in any order that suits your investigation
2. **Add missions as needed** - Your AI partner can create custom missions for specific skills
3. **Remove missions** - Skip what you already know
4. **Practice between missions** - Use `sandbox/` for training
5. **Document discoveries** - Track tokens and patterns
6. **Master the techniques** - Dr. Vimsworth's methods are the key

## CASE STATUS TRACKING

Monitor your progress in `achievements/progress.md`

**Clearance Levels:**
- 🥉 Bronze: Mission objectives completed
- 🥈 Silver: Bonus evidence discovered
- 🥇 Gold: Expert-level investigation

## THE INVESTIGATION

Detective, this isn't just about learning tools. Dr. Vimsworth left a trail - but where it leads, you'll have to discover yourself. Each mission contains clues, but the full picture only emerges through the investigation.

Some questions to consider:
- Why did her workspace remain active after she vanished?
- What was she really working on in her final weeks?
- Who else has been accessing these systems?
- What does "Project Prometheus" actually mean?

Every command you master brings you closer to answers. But be warned: the truth may be more complex than you expect.

**The investigation starts now.**

```bash
cd missions/01-tmux-workflows
nvim README.md
```

**Note:** Mission 01 teaches tmux - the foundation for all investigative work. You'll learn to create split panes, manage windows, and maintain persistent sessions. Every mission after this depends on these skills.
