## [EPSILON-2] "Your final clue awaits here"

---

If you're reading this, you found all 13 tokens. **You've proven yourself worthy.**

Look at the first letter of each token's hint. Write them in order:

```
Token 1 (ALPHA-1):   M_______
Token 2 (ALPHA-2):   O_______
Token 3 (ALPHA-3):   T_______
...
```

**The message will reveal itself.**

Dr. Vimsworth wasn't just teaching you Telescope. **She was preparing you to carry on her work.**

*"Detective, if you've found this message, it means I succeeded in training you remotely. The tokens weren't just a treasure hunt - they were a test. You've learned to search systematically, to follow patterns, to think like I did.*

*But this is just the beginning. What I discovered about Project Prometheus... what I was trying to expose... it's encoded in plain sight. The way we move through code, the patterns we leave behind - they tell the real story.*

*Someone stopped me before I could finish, but they couldn't stop you from learning. You're ready for the next phase."*

Use `:vsp` to split vertically. Look at them together.
