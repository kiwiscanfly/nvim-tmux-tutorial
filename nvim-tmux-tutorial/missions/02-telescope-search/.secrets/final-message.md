## [EPSILON-2] "Your final clue awaits here"

---

If you're reading this, you found all 13 tokens. **You've proven yourself worthy.**

**The secret message spells:**
*"MOTIONS-ARE-KEY"*

Decoded: **"MOTIONS ARE KEY"**

Dr. Vimsworth wasn't just teaching you Telescope. **She was preparing you to carry on her work.**

*"Detective, if you've found this message, it means I succeeded in training you remotely. The tokens weren't just a treasure hunt - they were a test. You've learned to search systematically, to follow patterns, to think like I did.*

*But this is just the beginning. What I discovered about Project Prometheus... what I was trying to expose... it's all in the motions. The way we move through code, the patterns we leave behind - they tell the real story.*

*Someone stopped me before I could finish, but they couldn't stop you from learning. You're ready for the next phase."*

## Easter Egg Hint

Open these two files side-by-side:
- `codebase/legacy-api.js`
- `codebase/parser.py`

Use `:vsp` to split vertically. Look at them together.
Can you see it?
