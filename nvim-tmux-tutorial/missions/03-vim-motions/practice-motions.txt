DR. VIMSWORTH'S MOTION LABORATORY

RECOVERED FROM: Her personal training directory
LAST ACCESSED: Daily, for 6 weeks before disappearance
CLASSIFICATION: Personal Training Regimen

"This is where I practiced in the evenings, after they stopped watching.
Every motion here became muscle memory. Every pattern became instinct.
Use this space as I did - to train until the commands disappear and only speed remains."
