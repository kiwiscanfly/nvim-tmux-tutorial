----------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1847: Memory Leak in Authentication
----------------------------------------------
Priority: HIGH
Component: auth-service
First observed: 2024-03-10

Description:
The authentication service exhibits unusual memory growth
when processing concurrent login requests. Memory usage
increases by ~500MB per hour under load.

[TOKEN-ALPHA-1] "The database remembers everything"

Stack trace:
  at AuthService.validateToken (auth-service.js:142)
  at middleware.authenticate (middleware.js:89)
  at processRequest (server.js:234)

Reproduction:
1. Start auth service
2. Run load test with 1000 concurrent users
3. Monitor memory usage over 4 hours
4. Observe linear growth pattern

----------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1823: SQL Injection Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------
Priority: CRITICAL
Component: database-layer
First observed: 2024-03-08

Description:
Legacy API endpoints don't properly sanitize user input
before constructing SQL queries. This affects the user
search functionality specifically.

Affected endpoints:
- GET /api/v1/users/search
- POST /api/v1/users/filter
- GET /api/legacy/user-lookup

HINT: Check the database schema for more clues about
how this vulnerability manifests.

----------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1809: Race Condition in Cache
----------------------------------------------
Priority: MEDIUM
Component: cache-manager
First observed: 2024-03-05

Description:
Under high concurrency, the cache manager occasionally
returns stale data or causes duplicate writes to the
backing store. Appears related to the locking mechanism.

NOTE: The pattern appears in multiple services. Search
for "cache" across the codebase to find all instances.

----------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1798: Typo in Function Name
----------------------------------------------
Priority: LOW
Component: utils
First observed: 2024-03-01

Description:
Someone misspelled "function" as "functoin" in the
utility library. This is now part of the public API
and we can't change it without breaking compatibility.

"Never underestimate the permanence of temporary code."

----------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1776: Configuration Not Loading
----------------------------------------------
Priority: MEDIUM
Component: config-loader
First observed: 2024-02-28

Description:
Environment-specific configurations intermittently fail
to load on application startup. Defaults are used instead,
leading to confusion in production.

The config files are scattered. Try searching for .yaml
or .json files to locate them all.
