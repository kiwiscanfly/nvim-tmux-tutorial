FILE METADATA (Recovered from git history):
Author: Dr. Elena Vimsworth
Date: 2022-03-13 14:22:19
Commit Message: "Update project status before review meeting"

FORENSIC NOTE: This file was modified 2 days before disappearance.

Time taken: 3.2 seconds (inhuman speed for manual editing).
Method: Visual block mode - classic Vimsworth technique.

TIP: Use Ctrl+v to select the Status column, then 'c' to change all at once!
This is exactly how she did it under surveillance.
