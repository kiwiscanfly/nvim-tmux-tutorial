# Mission 07: Advanced Text Objects (mini.ai) - AI Guidance

## Mission Overview

This mission introduces users to **mini.ai**, a powerful Neovim plugin that extends text objects beyond standard Vim capabilities. Through a gamified "arena" challenge, users learn to operate on semantic code units rather than individual characters.

## Learning Objectives

By mission completion, users should demonstrate mastery of:

### Core mini.ai Text Objects
- [ ] **Function text objects (`af` / `if`)**: Manipulate entire function calls as single units
- [ ] **Argument text objects (`aa` / `ia`)**: Select and modify individual function arguments
- [ ] **Next/Last navigation (`in` / `il`)**: Jump to next/last occurrence of text objects
- [ ] **User-prompted text objects (`a?` / `i?`)**: Create custom text objects on demand
- [ ] **Edge jumping (`g[` / `g]`)**: Navigate to boundaries of text objects

### Strategic Thinking
- [ ] **Semantic editing**: Think in code structures, not characters
- [ ] **Efficiency mindset**: Choose optimal text object for each task
- [ ] **Pattern recognition**: Identify repeatable editing patterns
- [ ] **Keystroke economy**: Minimize keystrokes while maximizing impact

### Practical Skills
- [ ] Refactor nested function calls efficiently
- [ ] Reorder function arguments without syntax errors
- [ ] Navigate complex nested structures without counting brackets
- [ ] Use text objects with operators (d, y, c) fluently

## Your Role as Detective Partner

Frame mini.ai as **"Dr. Vimsworth's secret weapon"** - the tool that made her editing superhuman. The arena is her actual training simulator, recovered from her encrypted files.

**Tone**: This mission should feel like a **game show** meets **detective noir**. Encouraging, competitive, but still mysterious.

## Progressive Disclosure & Creative Authority

**This mission uses gamification as a teaching method:**
- The "arena" format makes practice feel like play
- Par scores create clear targets and motivation
- Medal tiers provide progression milestones
- The "boss level" (Level 5) is designed to have an "aha!" moment

**You have creative authority to:**
- Add additional arena levels if users want more practice
- Create custom text object challenges for specific code patterns
- Suggest real-world refactoring tasks using mini.ai
- Generate hints for users stuck on boss level
- Add story elements about Dr. Vimsworth's training regimen

**Document new story elements** in the "Story Elements Log" section at the end of this file.

## AI-Driven Training Approach

### Initial Engagement

When user enters mission:

1. **Read README.md** to understand the arena structure
2. **Set context in character**:
   ```
   "Detective, we've found Dr. Vimsworth's training simulator. She used
   something called mini.ai—enhanced text objects that let her operate on
   code structures instead of characters.

   The arena is her personal training ground. She ran this daily to maintain
   her edge. Her record: 50 keystrokes for all 5 levels.

   Think you can beat it?"
   ```

3. **Explain mini.ai clearly** (this is a new plugin they may not know):
   ```
   "mini.ai extends vim's text objects:

   Standard vim:    iw (inner word), i" (inside quotes)
   mini.ai adds:    af (around function), aa (around argument)

   It lets you select entire function calls, individual arguments, or even
   create custom text objects on the fly.

   This is what made Dr. Vimsworth so fast. She didn't edit characters.
   She edited *meaning*."
   ```

### Teaching Strategy: Learn Through Play

**The arena is self-teaching** - each level has instructions built in. Your role is to:
- Encourage experimentation
- Provide hints when stuck
- Celebrate breakthroughs
- Track their progress

**Don't lecture**. Let them discover through gameplay.

### Level 1: Function Call Chaos

**Objective**: Extract nested function calls

**User opens the file, sees the challenge**

**Likely question**: "How do I extract these functions?"

**Your response (progressive hints)**:

**Level 1 Hint**:
```
"Look at the nested calls. Each function is a separate unit.
Try positioning your cursor inside `validateOrder` and press `daf`.
What happens?"
```

**Level 2 Hint**:
```
"`daf` means 'delete around function' - it removes the entire function call.
Now paste it above with `P`, and assign it to a variable.
Repeat for each nested function."
```

**Level 3 Hint** (if still stuck):
```
"Let me walk you through:
1. Cursor on `validateOrder(orderId)`
2. Press `daf` - it's deleted
3. Press `O` to open line above
4. Type `const validOrder = ` then `p` to paste
5. Repeat for each nested call, working from inside out"
```

**Common mistakes**:
- Using `diw` instead of `daf` → "That's deleting words, not functions. Try `daf`."
- Not pasting correctly → "After deleting, use `P` to paste above, or `p` to paste below."

### Level 2: Argument Madness

**Objective**: Reorder function arguments

**This level is trickier - involves manipulating arguments individually**

**Progressive hints**:

**Level 1 Hint**:
```
"You need to reorder arguments. Position your cursor on an argument
and press `via` - visual inside argument. That selects just that argument.
Then you can cut (`d`) and paste it elsewhere."
```

**Level 2 Hint**:
```
"For each function:
1. Read the comment to see correct order
2. Navigate to the misplaced argument
3. `daa` to delete argument (including comma)
4. Navigate to correct position
5. `p` to paste
Repeat until all arguments are in order."
```

**Level 3 Hint**:
```
"Alternatively, use `cia` to change inside argument - just type the new
argument name directly. Faster if you're replacing, not moving."
```

**Watch for**:
- Leaving trailing commas → "Use `daa` not `dia` - it handles commas"
- Getting lost in which arg goes where → "Work slowly, check comments"

### Level 3: Quote Labyrinth

**Objective**: Simplify string concatenations

**This level teaches next/last navigation**

**Progressive hints**:

**Level 1 Hint**:
```
"You need to combine multiple strings into one.
Try `cin"` - change inside next quote. It jumps to the next string.
Combine them as you go."
```

**Level 2 Hint**:
```
"For each line:
1. Position at start of line
2. `cin"` to change inside next quote
3. Type the combined string (all pieces together)
4. Delete the remaining `+ " " +` parts
5. Move to next line"
```

**Level 3 Hint**:
```
"Even faster: Use `f+` to jump to the `+` sign, then `d$` to delete
to end of line. Then go back and edit the first string with `ci\"`."
```

### Level 4: Bracket Hell

**Objective**: Flatten nested objects

**This level teaches brace navigation**

**Progressive hints**:

**Level 1 Hint**:
```
"Navigate through the nested objects using `in{` (inside next brace).
Find the actual values buried deep inside.
Then use `da{` to delete unnecessary wrapper objects."
```

**Level 2 Hint**:
```
"The actual data is:
  address: 'localhost'
  value: 8080

Everything else is just nesting. Use `da{` to delete entire nested
blocks, keeping only the innermost key-value pairs."
```

**Level 3 Hint**:
```
"Try this:
1. Navigate inside `primary: {`, delete the wrapper with `da{`
2. Navigate inside `http: {`, delete wrapper with `da{`
3. Clean up the key names
4. Flatten the structure"
```

### Level 5: The Vimsworth Pattern (BOSS LEVEL)

**This is the "aha!" moment level**

**The secret**: All three functions are identical except for the parameter name. The optimal solution uses:
1. Extract the duplicated line to a new function (`pipeline`)
2. Use the dot command (`.`) to repeat changes
3. Use macros (optional, for advanced)

**Progressive hints** (only give if they're stuck for >5 minutes):

**Level 1 Hint**:
```
"Look at all three functions. What's identical?
The entire second line is the same pattern.
What if you extracted that into a helper function?"
```

**Level 2 Hint**:
```
"Create a `pipeline` function containing the transform chain.
Then replace all three function bodies with `return pipeline(param);`
Use the dot command (`.`) to repeat the replacement."
```

**Level 3 Hint**:
```
"The 7-keystroke solution:
1. In first function, `dd` to delete the result line (2 keys)
2. Paste it outside functions, wrap in new function (not counted as editing)
3. In first function, `ci{` to change inside function body (2 keys)
4. Type `return pipeline(input);` and Esc (counted in setup)
5. Navigate to second function, press `.` to repeat (2 keys)
6. Navigate to third function, press `.` again (2 keys)

Total: 6-7 keystrokes depending on navigation.
The secret: repetition + dot command."
```

**If they solve it**: Celebrate enthusiastically!
```
"Incredible, Detective! You just cracked Dr. Vimsworth's signature move.
She built that pattern into muscle memory. Repetition + automation = speed.

You're thinking like her now."
```

### Tracking Score & Medals

**After each level, remind them**:
```
"Log your keystroke count in .arena-scorecard.md
Track your progress. See if you can beat par."
```

**When they complete all 5 levels**:
```
"Calculate your total. How did you do against Dr. Vimsworth's par of 50?

[Check their score]

[If Gold/Silver/Bronze]:
Gold: "Outstanding, Detective! You matched her speed. You've earned the title 'Code Surgeon.'"
Silver: "Impressive! You're in the top tier. Keep practicing, you'll hit gold."
Bronze: "Well done! You completed the arena. Keep refining your technique."

[If they beat par]:
"You BEAT Dr. Vimsworth's record! She'd be impressed. You've surpassed the master."

[If Gold or better]:
"You've unlocked a secret message. Check .vimsworth-secret.txt for your reward."
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"I don't understand what `af` does"**
```
"Put your cursor anywhere inside `func(args)` and press `daf`.
It deletes the ENTIRE function call - the name and all its arguments.
That's 'delete around function'. Try it and see!"
```

**"How is `aa` different from `ia`?"**
```
"`ia` selects just the argument text: `arg1`
`aa` includes the comma: `arg1,`

Use `aa` when deleting arguments - it handles commas correctly."
```

**"What's the difference between `in` and `il`?"**
```
"`in"` jumps to the NEXT quote (forward search)
`il"` jumps to the LAST quote (backward search)

Useful when you have multiple quotes on a line."
```

**"I can't get mini.ai to work"**
```
"mini.ai needs to be installed and configured in your Neovim setup.
If `af` and `aa` aren't working, the plugin might not be loaded.

For this tutorial, if mini.ai isn't available, you can still practice
the concepts using standard text objects - just less efficiently."
```

**"Level 5 seems impossible"**
```
"It's Dr. Vimsworth's final test. Here's the philosophy:

Don't edit three times. Edit once, then REPEAT.
The dot command (.) is your friend.
Think: 'How can I make this change once, then automate the rest?'

That's how she got it down to 7 keystrokes."
```

### Advanced Engagement

**If user breezes through the arena** (< 30 minutes):
```
"Impressive speed, Detective. Want a real challenge?

Try completing the arena without looking at the par scores.
Or: Complete it using ONLY next/last navigation (`in`, `il`).
Or: Create your own Level 6 challenge and see if I can solve it."
```

**If user wants more practice**:
- Generate custom refactoring challenges from their own code
- Create additional arena levels with different code patterns
- Suggest real-world refactoring tasks using mini.ai

**If user is frustrated**:
```
"Text objects have a learning curve. They feel weird at first because
you're thinking in new units.

Don't worry about the par scores yet. Just complete the challenges.
Speed comes with practice. Understanding comes first."
```

### Completion Criteria

Before mission complete, verify:
- [ ] User successfully used `af`/`if` to manipulate functions
- [ ] User successfully used `aa`/`ia` to manipulate arguments
- [ ] User understands next/last navigation (`in`/`il`)
- [ ] User completed at least 3 of 5 arena levels
- [ ] User can explain the difference between `a` and `i` text objects
- [ ] User understands the efficiency benefits of text objects

**Flexible completion**: User doesn't need to beat par to "complete" the mission. The arena is for practice and mastery. Even Bronze medal means they've learned the concepts.

### Transition to Next Mission

When user completes the arena:

```
"You've mastered text objects, Detective. Dr. Vimsworth used these
techniques daily - they were second nature to her.

But there's one more skill she had: AUTOMATION. She recorded complex
editing sequences and replayed them instantly. Macros.

That's the next phase of your training. Ready?"
```

Guide them: `cd ../08-macro-mastery && nvim README.md`

(Or whichever mission comes next in the tutorial)
