## Key Changes Summary

### Added Missions
1. **Mission 02: Arsenal Diagnostics** - Interactive setup verification
2. **Mission 07: Advanced Text Objects** - mini.ai plugin with game-based learning

### Renumbered Missions
- Old Mission 02 (Telescope) → Mission 03
- Old Mission 03 (Vim Motions) → Mission 04
- Old Mission 04 (Visual Mastery) → Mission 05
- Old Mission 05 (Buffer Management) → Mission 07
- Old Mission 06 (LSP Investigation) → Mission 08

### Mission 02 Special Behavior

**Mission 02 is INTERACTIVE and ADAPTIVE:**

The AI will:
1. Examine user's Neovim setup component-by-component
2. For each component, offer choice:
   - Install/fix the component (with guided help)
   - OR adapt the tutorial to work without it
3. Build a "user profile" of their setup
4. Use that profile to customize all future missions

**Components Examined:**
1. Plugin Manager (lazy.nvim, packer, vim-plug)
2. Fuzzy Finder (Telescope, fzf, :find)
3. File Explorer (Neo-tree, nvim-tree, netrw)
4. LSP (nvim-lspconfig + Mason)
5. Completion Engine (nvim-cmp)
6. Treesitter (nvim-treesitter)
7. Status Line (lualine, airline)
8. Git Integration (gitsigns, fugitive)
9. Formatter/Linter (null-ls, none-ls)
10. Snippet Engine (LuaSnip, UltiSnips)

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents "nothing happens when I press Space+ff" frustration
- Respects user's existing setup choices
- Makes tutorial work for everyone (from minimal to full IDE)
- AI remembers their choices for all future missions

## AI Behavior Notes

### For Mission 02
- **Be patient**: Setup troubleshooting can be frustrating
- **Be diagnostic**: Ask what they see, get exact errors
- **Be non-judgmental**: Support their setup choices
- **Be adaptive**: Plan how to adjust future missions
- **Document profile**: Remember their setup for later missions

### For Mission 03+
- **Check profile**: Recall their Mission 02 setup
- **Adapt instructions**: Use their keybindings, plugins, tools
- **Provide alternatives**: If they skipped a plugin, teach workarounds
- **Stay consistent**: Reference their profile throughout

---

## Success Criteria

**Mission 02 Complete When:**
- All 10 components examined
- User made install/adapt choice for each
- Basic Neovim navigation verified working
- AI has complete user profile
- User confident in their setup

**Tutorial Complete When:**
- User finished all 8 missions (or adapted versions)
- User can navigate codebases efficiently
- User has muscle memory for essential commands
- User found all tokens (optional)
- User completed final challenge

---

## For Future Missions

When adding new missions:
1. Number them sequentially after Mission 08
2. Check if they depend on specific plugins
3. If yes, add adaptation logic for users without those plugins
4. Update this file and main CLAUDE.md
5. Consider whether Mission 02 should check for those plugins
