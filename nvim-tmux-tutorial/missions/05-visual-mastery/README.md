## 📋 The Case

**Digital Forensics Report - Code Analysis Unit**

Dr. Vimsworth's final project commits show an unusual pattern: **massive code refactoring completed in impossibly short timeframes.** Visual selection logs reveal the truth:

**Block Selection Evidence:**
- 47 files modified in 12 minutes
- Column-based edits across multiple files simultaneously
- Surgical precision: only sensitive data extracted, normal code left intact

**Her nickname "The Text Surgeon" was earned here.** Visual mode wasn't just editing - it was data extraction. She could select, copy, and extract classified information from massive codebases while leaving no trace of what was actually taken.

**The visual challenges aren't exercises - they're her actual extraction techniques.** Learn her methods. Understand how she could steal terabytes of evidence right under their noses.

**Your mission**: Master the same surgical precision she used to expose the truth.

## 🎯 Objectives

- [ ] Master visual block mode (Ctrl+v)
- [ ] Complete column editing challenge
- [ ] Refactor Python code using visual selections
- [ ] Create ASCII art modifications

## 🛠️ Visual Modes

- `v` - Visual character mode
- `V` - Visual line mode
- `Ctrl+v` - Visual block mode
- `gv` - Reselect last selection

## 📊 Challenges - Reconstruction of Her Methods

### 1. Data Sanitization (columns.csv)
**Scenario**: Hide project status from supervisors
- Target: Change all "TODO" statuses to "IN_PROGRESS"
- **Dr. Vimsworth's Method**: Visual block mode for simultaneous multi-line editing
- **Why**: Make her project appear further along while she extracted evidence

### 2. Code Extraction (refactor-me.py)
**Scenario**: Extract sensitive algorithms without raising suspicion
- Target: Remove repeated code patterns that contained classified logic
- **Dr. Vimsworth's Method**: Visual mode selection + surgical removal
- **Why**: Extract the evidence while making it look like normal code cleanup

### 3. Steganography Practice (ascii-art.txt)
**Scenario**: Hide messages in plain sight
- Target: Modify ASCII art to embed coordinates or meeting locations
- **Dr. Vimsworth's Method**: Visual block editing to alter specific character patterns
- **Why**: Communication method that security scanners would ignore

**Security Note**: Each challenge teaches a technique she used in her final weeks.
