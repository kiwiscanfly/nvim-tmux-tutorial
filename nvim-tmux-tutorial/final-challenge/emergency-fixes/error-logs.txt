=== DR. VIMSWORTH'S FINAL NOTE ===
"The bugs are simple once you see them. Trust your training.
 Use Telescope to search. Use motions to fix. Use visual mode
 if you need to change multiple lines at once. And remember:
 the `.` command is your friend for repeated fixes.

 You've got this. I made sure of it."

=== QUICK FIX GUIDE ===
1. Start with database-config.js (it's the quickest)
2. Then web-app.js (one line to add)
3. Finally api-service.js (one line to remove)

Time limit: 15 minutes
Your training ends here, Detective.
