## 📬 INCOMING MESSAGE

```
From: Dr. Elena Vimsworth
To: Detective
Subject: You Did It

If you're reading this, you fixed all three systems.
More importantly, you've mastered the tools I left for you.

I didn't disappear. I transcended.

The truth is: I've been working on something bigger than
Project Prometheus. Something that requires complete focus.
No distractions. No GitHub notifications. No Slack messages.

I left these tutorials not as breadcrumbs to find me, but
as tools to help you become what I was - a developer who
thinks at the speed of their tools, unencumbered by the
friction of inefficient workflows.

You don't need to find me. You've already found what I
wanted you to discover: mastery.

Keep practicing. Keep building. The motions will become
invisible. The tools will become thought.

And when you reach that state, you'll understand why I left.

— Elena

P.S. The real treasure was the vim motions you learned along
the way. (Sorry, I had to.)
