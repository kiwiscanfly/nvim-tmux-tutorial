## 🎯 Mission Briefing

**Time Limit:** 15 minutes
**Systems Affected:** 3
**Stakes:** Maximum

## 🔧 Your Task

1. **Create a tmux monitoring dashboard** with 4 panes:
   - Top-left: Tail the error logs
   - Top-right: Neovim with the buggy code
   - Bottom-left: Test runner
   - Bottom-right: Notes/commands

2. **Diagnose the issues** in all three systems:
   - Web app (port 3000) - Authentication failing
   - API service (port 8080) - Memory leak
   - Database - Connection timeout

3. **Fix the bugs** using only vim motions (no mouse!)

4. **Verify** all systems are operational

## 📁 Files to Check

```
emergency-fixes/
├── web-app.js (authentication bug)
├── api-service.js (memory leak)
├── database-config.js (connection issue)
└── error-logs.txt (diagnostic info)
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

**Bronze:** Fix all 3 bugs
**Silver:** Fix all bugs in under 15 minutes
**Gold:** Fix all bugs under 10 minutes using optimal vim motions

## 🚀 Start Command

```bash
# Start your timer NOW!
cd emergency-fixes
tmux new -s rescue-mission

# Set up your dashboard layout
# Then: nvim error-logs.txt
```

## 📝 Hints

- The bugs are interconnected
- Use Telescope to find related code quickly
- The error logs contain crucial clues
- Visual block mode might save you time
- Remember: `.` repeats your last change

## 🎉 Victory Condition

When all tests pass, a secret message will appear revealing what happened to Dr. Vimsworth.

**Ready? Your 15 minutes start when you open the files.**

Good luck, Detective. You've been trained for this.
